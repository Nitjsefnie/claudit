"""Every field the API sends must be read by the frontend.

The dashboard payload had grown three dead limbs that nothing rendered:
`ctx_lines` (140 KB per response plus a 271ms query), `burns` (24 KB),
and a `file_key` on all 8,892 ctx_traces entries that was assigned to an
`id` no component ever read. Together with `sessions[].turns` — which
duplicated data already in `ctx_traces` — that was most of a 3.2 MB
response.

Nobody notices this by reading code: a field goes unused when its
consumer is deleted or rewritten, and the producer keeps paying for it in
query time, transfer and browser parse. So assert it instead.

The check is deliberately a text search, not real JS analysis. The
frontend is untyped in-browser JSX with no build step, so there is no
import graph to walk; a name appearing anywhere in `src/` is treated as
used. That direction of error is the safe one — this test under-reports
(a field referenced only in a comment passes) and will not fail on a
field that is genuinely read. It exists to catch the blatant case: a
field no file mentions at all.

To keep a field the UI does not read (an external consumer, a debugging
aid), add it to ALLOWED_UNUSED with the reason.
