"""The pools must never hand out a connection that died while idle.

A pooled connection whose server-side backend went away (PostgreSQL restart,
idle-session timeout, a `pg_terminate_backend`) still looks usable to the
pool: it is only discovered to be dead when the request that was handed it
tries to run a query, and that request fails. The pools must validate a
connection on checkout and recycle a dead one instead of serving it.

Everything here runs in-process: `_FakeConnection` stands in for
`psycopg.Connection`, so the test opens no socket and touches no database.
The pool machinery itself is the real `psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool`.
