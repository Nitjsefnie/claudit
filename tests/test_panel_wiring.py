"""Source-level guards for two JSX wiring mistakes that render silently.

Neither is catchable by the rest of the suite: node cannot parse JSX and
nothing here renders React, so a panel can pass every test while drawing
nothing (see test_vbar_label_geometry.py's note on that boundary). Both
of these shipped in the Cost by Context panel and were found by a human
looking at the screen, which is the failure mode these assertions close.

1. `COL` is keyed by SERIES NAME. Indexing it numerically yields
   undefined, and an SVG <rect fill={undefined}> renders BLACK while a
   <path stroke={undefined}> renders nothing -- no error, no warning.
2. `DashTooltip` takes ONE `tip` prop. Spreading the tip object instead
   leaves `tip` undefined, so its `if (!tip) return null` fires on every
   hover and the panel is silently unhoverable.
