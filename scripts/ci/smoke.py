"""Boot the real server and check it actually serves.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The pytest suite mounts `api.router` into a clean
FastAPI app, which is the right call for testing endpoints in isolation —
but it means `backend/app.py` is never executed as the application. Three
things live only there and are therefore only checked here:

  * `db.schema_check()`, the fail-fast that aborts startup on a bad schema
    (SV-SCHEMA-FAIL-FAST). A suite that never boots the app cannot tell
    you the fail-fast still fires.
  * the startup ingest and the APScheduler wiring around it.
  * the auth middleware and the index.html rewrite, both of which the
    router-only tests deliberately mount around.

Run against a throwaway Postgres and the committed fixtures/r2_mini
mirror. Usable locally, not just in CI:

    PGHOST=localhost PGUSER=postgres python3 scripts/ci/smoke.py

Exits nonzero with the server's own log on any failure.
