"""R2 → Postgres ingest.

Per-file granularity: every *.jsonl under bucket root → one row in `files`
+ N rows in `records` (per Phase-1-deduped record). Cross-file uuid
dedup is a query-time concern.

Reparse trigger per FILE: row missing OR etag changed OR parser_version
mismatch. Orphan files (R2 key gone) are deleted. CASCADE drops records.

Per-session work spans TWO transactions:
  1. DELETE FROM records WHERE file_key=... + INSERT INTO files (UPSERT)
     + bulk INSERT INTO records — all in one transaction so a crash
     mid-loop leaves either the old state or the new state.
  2. (Implicit) The orphan delete + projects upserts also commit in
     their own scopes; partial progress is fine because the sessions
     row's etag is only updated when the per-file txn lands.
