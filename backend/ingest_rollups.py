"""Derived-state rebuilds: the tables ingest recomputes from `records`.

Split out of backend/ingest.py, which crossed pylint's 1000-line gate —
the same seam api.py was split along. Nothing here fetches, parses or
persists; every function reads what the ingest walk already wrote and
rewrites one derived table. They are called in order by
ingest._rebuild_derived_state(), and that order is load-bearing:
suppression removes rows the canonical pass would otherwise rank, and
every rollup reads is_canonical.

Re-exported from backend.ingest so existing callers keep working.

    Claude Code writes every session under one tree no matter which
    endpoint served it, so resuming a session on the other lane
    interleaves that provider's assistant entries into a transcript this
    deploy's bucket already owns. Those rows are real usage but not ours,
    and pricing them against our rate table invents a cost.

    Suppression is a DELETE rather than a read-time filter because every
    read path and every rollup already reads `records` as the truth; one
    deletion keeps them all consistent without fifteen extra predicates
    that a new endpoint could forget. `tool_uses` for the same lines go
    too, otherwise the tool panels keep counting calls whose model row is
    gone (they LEFT JOIN records, so the calls would resurface as an
    unlabelled model).

    Patterns are matched with ILIKE, so 'glm-%' covers a family and a bare
    model id still matches exactly. Runs before the canonical pass on
    EVERY ingest, not only when files changed, so adding a pattern takes
    effect on the next run. Removing one brings the rows back only on a
