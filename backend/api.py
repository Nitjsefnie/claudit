"""Read endpoints. All gated by session.auth_middleware via path prefix /api/.

Per-FILE / per-RECORD shape (R1+R2+R3+R4):
  - /api/projects: list of projects with file_count + total_cost
  - /api/cache: literal compute_cache replica (per-model + top10 + buckets)
  - /api/sessions/{id}/transcript: raw bytes for Inspector (LRU cache)
  - /api/sessions/{id}/sidecar: path-validated sidecar fetch

Legacy compatibility shims (R11) for the restored Dashboard / SessionsList /
SessionView frontend (post-revert of R9). Sourced from new files+records
tables but returning OLD response shape:
  - /api/dashboard:        hourly aggregates + burns + ctx_lines
  - /api/sessions:         paginated session list
  - /api/sessions/{id}:    single session detail

Module layout (issue #8 split — the single file outgrew pylint's
1000-line gate): shared helpers live in backend/api_common.py; the
endpoint groups in backend/api_export.py, backend/api_dashboard.py,
backend/api_sessions.py and backend/api_cache.py each define their own
APIRouter, included below. This file keeps the panel endpoints that
were small enough to stay.

    `range` convention /api/dashboard takes (`_parse_range`, default
    "30d").

    Projects whose ALL-TIME cost is 0 are dropped entirely (never-cost
    projects are noise). A project with all-time cost but nothing in the
    selected range is still returned — sorted to the bottom with a cost
    of 0 — since this is a re-sort of the existing list, not a range
    filter; the ALL-TIME-zero exclusion and the RANGE-scoped ordering are
    two different aggregates and must not be conflated.

    Cost comes from usage_rollup instead of joining every record: this
    used to fan `projects x files x records` out to ~296k rows and was
    the slowest uncached call on a page load after /api/dashboard.

    The aggregates are computed in separate subqueries rather than by
    stacking two LEFT JOINs — joining files AND records first multiplied
    the file rows by their record count, so COUNT(f.file_key) reported
