# a read cannot re-bucket to a different width, so changing either
# constant requires rebuilding the rollup (bump nothing else -- the
# rollup derives from stored `records` columns, so no reparse).

# y-axis is scaled off the maximum: one 115.8M row in the `zai` bucket,
# written by another harness under the all-zeros sentinel session id,
