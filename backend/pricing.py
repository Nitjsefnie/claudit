"""Per-model cost rates (USD per million tokens).

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for cost in claudit. Mirrored by src/parser.js
(SV-PARSER-SPEC) — keep both in lockstep. Bump PARSER_VERSION when this
table changes; every session reparses.

Cache writes are split by TTL:
  5m write = 1.25x base input (column 'create_5m')
  1h write = 2x base input    (column 'create_1h')

Tokens recorded as cache_creation_input_tokens with NO ephemeral_5m/1h
split (older SDK versions) are charged at the 5m rate — conservative
undercount, not overcount. See SV-COST-SPLIT in
.claude/rules/claudit-doctrine.md.

Three resolution behaviours matter, in priority order:

1. EXACT — the normalised model id matches a key in MODEL_RATES, allowing
   only a dated-snapshot or bracket suffix after it. A version suffix the
   table doesn't know (``claude-opus-4-9``) deliberately does NOT match the
   shorter ``claude-opus-4`` key: billing a future Opus at retired 15/75
   rates is a silent 3x overcount.
2. TIER — an unrecognised Claude model falls back to its family's
   current-generation rates and is reported as ``kind="tier"`` so callers
   can mark the figure estimated rather than presenting it as fact.
3. DEFAULT — anything else. Also flagged.

Rates are a function of (model, timestamp): a model may carry dated
overrides (e.g. an introductory price). Cost must be computed against the
timestamp of the request being priced, not the time of rendering.
