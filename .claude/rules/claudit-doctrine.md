# claudit Doctrine

Local rules for the claudit repo. Global rules under `~/.claude/rules/**` still apply.

## Parser-spec ownership (SV-PARSER-SPEC)

The CANONICAL parser is `~/.claude/scripts/parse_session.py` (owned by
analyst). Both the in-browser `src/parser.js` AND the backend
`backend/parse.py` MIRROR that semantics. Keep all three in lockstep on:

- Per-file requestId `_merge_usage_max` during ingest (Phase 1,
  persisted into `records`)
- Cross-file UUID dedup, resolved at INGEST into `records.is_canonical`
  (see SV-CANONICAL-FLAG). The winner is still exactly what
  `DISTINCT ON (uuid) ORDER BY uuid, file_key` picked at read time.
  There is still no persisted Phase 2 rollup; the per-session SUM
  aggregation that used to live in `compute_cache` was dropped in R1.
- `<task-notification>` ref detection for sub-agent jsonls
- Sidecar `data/subagents/agent-*.jsonl` resolution
- `MODEL_RATES` table (single source of truth: `backend/pricing.py`,
  initially copied from parse_session.py:1148-1166)

When you find a discrepancy: the Python canonical is right by default.
If the canonical itself has a real bug, file it for analyst via mailbox;
don't quietly fork the semantics here.

## Cost accounting is split TTL, always (SV-COST-SPLIT)

Every place this repo computes cost from `usage` records MUST split
`cache_creation` into `ephemeral_5m` and `ephemeral_1h` and apply the
correct multiplier:

- 5m write: 1.25× base input rate
- 1h write: 2× base input rate
- Tokens with no `ephemeral_*` split (legacy SDK records) charged at the
  5m rate (conservative undercount, not overcount).

Single-rate `cache_create` cost is BANNED. If you bump `MODEL_RATES`,
also bump `PARSER_VERSION` in `backend/constants.py` so the next ingest reparses every
session.

## Backend is the ONLY load path (SV-NO-LOCAL-UPLOAD)

Supersedes SV-IN-BROWSER-FALLBACK, which required a drag-drop offline
fallback. That fallback was removed on 2026-07-21: there is now no way to
feed a transcript in from the browser — no drag-drop target, no
`FileReader`, no zip expansion, and no JSZip dependency. The only jsonls
the app reads come from R2, owned by the same operator.

There is still no upload endpoint and no server-side parsing of
operator-supplied jsonls. Do not reintroduce either, and do not add a
file picker as a "convenience" — an ingress path is exactly what was cut.

`src/parser.js` is NOT dead code and must stay. It still serves two live
consumers: `loadFromBackend()` parses the bytes from
`/api/sessions/{id}/transcript` client-side via `parseTranscript` +
`computeSessionStats`, and the Token Breakdown panel prices rows through
`window.rateForModel`. Its rate table remains bound to `backend/pricing.py`
by SV-PARSER-SPEC and the node parity test.

## Bundle distribution NOT applicable (SV-NO-BUNDLE)

claudit does not ship via `claude-setup.zip`. Distribution path is
git (this repo) + `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`.

## Test fixtures stay small (SV-FIXTURE-SIZE)

`fixtures/parser/*.jsonl` are hand-crafted single-record samples,
each under 1 KB. `fixtures/r2_mini/` is the end-to-end mini mirror
(2 projects, 4 sessions, 1 sidecar, 1 cross-session shared uuid).
Don't grow either by accident — larger samples go under
`/tmp/analyst.BCYKic3p/r2/` (the local R2 mirror, not committed).

## Read-only on canonical paths (SV-READ-ONLY-CANONICAL)

claudit NEVER edits `~/.claude/scripts/parse_session.py` or
`~/.claude/scripts/discord_mb.py`. Those are owned by analyst, and per
global doctrine they are NOT copied, symlinked, or hardlinked into this
repo — invoke them by absolute path under `~/.claude/scripts/`.

## Schema is applied at startup, not by a human (SV-SCHEMA-AUTOAPPLY)

`db.apply_schema()` runs `backend/schema.sql` on every boot, before
`schema_check()`, under a Postgres advisory lock so concurrent boots do
not race the same DDL. The file is idempotent by construction, which is
what makes this safe to repeat.

The manual `psql ... -f backend/schema.sql` step is no longer load-bearing:
a deploy that pulls code writing a new column converges the database
instead of aborting every ingest with `UndefinedColumn` while the
dashboard serves stale aggregates (issue #43, hit twice in one day across
the claudit and glmmeter deploys).

The cost is that ROLLBACK IS ONE-DIRECTIONAL — restarting an older binary
leaves it against a newer schema. That is acceptable ONLY while every
migration is additive and nullable, so an older binary ignores what it
does not know. A migration that DROPS or retypes a column breaks this
property and needs a different mechanism, not a quiet exception.

## Schema fail-fast (SV-SCHEMA-FAIL-FAST)

`backend/db.schema_check()` runs at every server startup. It verifies
(a) `claudit.files` exists and (b) the auth DB's `users.config` is a
JSONB column. Either failure aborts startup with a clear error rather
than silently degrading to a broken auth flow at first login.

## Per-file files+records contract (SV-FILES-RECORDS)

The schema is per-file, not per-session. Two tables hold the parse
output (see `backend/schema.sql`):

- `files(file_key PK, project_id, session_id, is_main, r2_etag,
  r2_size_bytes, r2_last_modified, parsed_at, parser_version,
  ctx_turns JSONB, turn_count)` — one row per ingested JSONL, with
  the context-growth trace inlined as `ctx_turns`.
- `records(file_key, line_num, uuid, request_id, ts, model,
  fresh_tokens, cache_creation_tokens, cache_read_tokens,
  output_tokens, eph5_tokens, eph1h_tokens, cost_usd)`
  PK `(file_key, line_num)` — one row per usage-bearing line AFTER
  per-file Phase 1 max-merge for matching `request_id`.

Cross-file uuid dedup is resolved at INGEST into `records.is_canonical`
(SV-CANONICAL-FLAG below). There is still NO persisted `record_uuids`
or `session_requests` table — both were dropped in R1 along with the
per-session rollup, the materialized hourly view, and the `sessions`
table. Reintroducing a persisted rollup or any cross-session table
requires a new migration, not a quiet code change.

## Dedup is a flag, not a read-time sort (SV-CANONICAL-FLAG)

`records.is_canonical` marks the row that
`DISTINCT ON (r.uuid) ORDER BY r.uuid, r.file_key` used to select at
read time. `line_num` breaks ties within a `file_key`, which the old
read-time ORDER BY left arbitrary. Rows with a NULL `uuid` are legacy
records kept verbatim (they were the `UNION ALL` leg) and are always
canonical.

Read endpoints MUST filter `WHERE is_canonical` and MUST NOT
reintroduce `DISTINCT ON (uuid)`. It was moved because `records` is
immutable between hourly ingests, yet every read re-sorted the whole
table to drop ~3.5% duplicates — `/api/cache` prefixed that dedup as a
CTE onto four queries and paid it four times per request (19.1s at
range=all; 0.52s after).

`ingest.recompute_canonical()` runs after EVERY successful ingest, not
only when files changed: adding or removing a FILE can change which row
wins for a uuid, and a freshly-migrated DB has the column defaulted to
TRUE across the board. The UPDATE only touches rows whose flag actually
flips, so a steady-state pass writes nothing. The column defaults to
TRUE so a migrated-but-not-yet-recomputed DB over-counts (behaves like
no dedup) rather than silently dropping rows.

Changing the winner rule means changing BOTH `recompute_canonical()`
and `src/parser.js`/`parse_session.py` semantics in lockstep
(SV-PARSER-SPEC).

## Foreign models are purged, not filtered (SV-SUPPRESSED-MODELS)

`suppressed_models(pattern, note, added_at)` lists models whose records
must not count. `ingest.purge_suppressed()` runs FIRST in
`_rebuild_derived_state()` — before the canonical pass — and DELETEs
matching `records` plus the `tool_uses` on the same lines.

Suppression is a delete, not a read-time predicate, because every read
path and every rollup already treats `records` as the truth; one deletion
keeps them consistent without ~15 extra filters a new endpoint could
forget. The `tool_uses` half is not optional: `tool_rollup` LEFT JOINs
`records` for the model, so a call whose record is gone reappears under a
NULL model.

Patterns are matched `model ILIKE pattern`, so `glm-%` covers a family
and a bare model id still matches exactly. The table ships EMPTY and must
stay that way in `schema.sql`: the same codebase is deployed over the
`zai` bucket as glmmeter, where `glm-%` would suppress everything.
Populate per deploy.

Why it exists: Claude Code writes every session under one tree whichever
endpoint served it, so resuming a session on the other lane interleaves
that provider's assistant entries into a transcript this bucket already
owns — real usage, but not ours, and priced against our table it invents
a cost. Removing a pattern brings the rows back only on a reparse (bump
`PARSER_VERSION`).

## Aggregates are precomputed at ingest (SV-ROLLUP)

`usage_rollup` holds pre-summed usage at grain
`(session_id, hour, model, is_main)`, rebuilt by
`ingest.rebuild_rollup()` after every successful ingest (AFTER
`recompute_canonical()` — it reads `is_canonical`). ~6.1k rows stand in
for ~286k records.

The grain is load-bearing, do not "simplify" it:

- **Keyed by HOUR, not by session.** A range filter sums only the
  in-range hours; a session-grained table would count a session
  straddling the boundary whole.
- **Carries MODEL.** A session's dominant model is
  `argmax(SUM(requests))` over the in-range rows — exactly what
  `MODE() WITHIN GROUP` computed from raw records, not an
  approximation.
- **Carries `first_ts`/`last_ts`.** Burn-rate span is
  `MAX(last_ts) - MIN(first_ts)`, which composes; a stored duration
  would not.

Only pure sums/counts/min/max may be served from it. **`PERCENTILE_CONT`
does not compose** — p50/p90 of a union of hours is not derivable from
per-hour p50/p90 — so `response_sizes` stays a live pass over `records`.
Do not "optimise" it onto the rollup.

The rollup is only valid for display buckets ≥ 1 hour. `/api/dashboard`
gates on `bucket_s >= 3600` and otherwise reads a live subquery shaped
with the same column names, so both paths share one set of queries. The
24h view buckets at 5 minutes and takes the live path.

It is derived state: anything that mutates `records` outside ingest must
rebuild or clear it, or reads serve a stale pre-aggregate. Totals are
verified equal to the equivalent `records` aggregate (requests, tokens,
cost, distinct sessions) — keep that true.

`ctx_cost_rollup` is the third of the composable kind, grain
`(hour, project_id, model, ctx_bucket)` holding `requests` + `cost_usd`.
It exists because `usage_rollup` CANNOT serve a cost-by-context panel:
that grain sums fresh/create/read across a whole (session, hour, model),
which destroys the PER-CALL window size the x-axis is made of. Bucketing
by that window at ingest keeps it, and the stored columns are pure sums,
so they compose across hours, projects and models alike.

Its bucket edges (`constants.CTX_BUCKET_WIDTH` / `CTX_BUCKET_MAX`) are
baked into stored rows exactly like `LATENCY_BUCKETS`: a read cannot
re-bucket to a different width, so changing either constant requires a
rollup rebuild. It does NOT require a `PARSER_VERSION` bump — the
context size is derived from stored `records` columns
(`fresh + cache_creation + cache_read`), not from a reparse.

`records` cascades from `files`; `files` cascades from `projects`.
Reparse is idempotent: deleting a file's `records` rows and
re-inserting on the next ingest leaves the table byte-identical.

## Failure causes and dispatches are stored, not re-derived (SV-WHY-COLUMNS)

`tool_uses.is_error` says THAT a call failed. Four columns say why, and
what a dispatch asked for:

- `error_kind` — `rejected` | `tool_error` | `failed`, NULL unless the
  call errored. HARNESS-GENERIC by rule: a PreToolUse hook denial carries
  the DEPLOY's wording, so it lands in `failed`. Do NOT add a kind for a
  particular operator's hooks — that couples a general tool to one setup.
- `error_text` — leading `parse.ERROR_TEXT_MAX` chars of the failed
  result. Grouping on it is how hook denials get separated from real
  failures, which is why the parser needs no hook vocabulary.
- `agent_type` / `agent_model` — read off an `Agent`/`Task` call's
  arguments. `files.agent_type` records what RAN and exists only when the
  subagent wrote a JSONL; these record what was ASKED for, so a dispatch
  that produced no file is still attributable.

`tool_error_rollup` and `dispatch_rollup` carry the composable halves
(pure counts). `error_text` is deliberately NOT in either grain —
unbounded cardinality does not belong in a rollup.

## The parser version is code, never the environment (SV-PARSER-VERSION)

`constants.PARSER_VERSION` is the ONLY switch that forces a reparse, and
it lives in code so the bump travels in the same commit as the change
that needs it. It used to be `os.environ.get("PARSER_VERSION", "1")`,
which let a parser change ship while every stored row stayed on the old
semantics with nothing to detect the drift. Do not reintroduce an env
override.

## Rates are a function of (model, timestamp) (SV-DATED-RATES)

`pricing.rate_for(model, ts)` — a model may carry dated overrides in
`DATED_RATES`, a list of `(end_exclusive_utc, rates)` windows per exact
model key. Cost must be computed against the timestamp of the request
being priced, never the time of rendering. `parse.py` passes each
record's own `ts`; omitting `ts` yields LIST price (conservative — never
silently applies a discount).

`DATED_RATES` is currently EMPTY and `RATE_EPOCHS` is `[]` — no live model
prices differently by date. The machinery stays regardless: the rule is
about the shape of pricing, not about whether a promotion happens to be
running. Tests drive it through the `synthetic_dated_rate` fixture in
`tests/conftest.py` rather than a live entry, so the path cannot rot while
the table is empty.

Any read path that RE-DERIVES rates from summed tokens must group by
`pricing.RATE_EPOCHS` (`api.rate_epoch_sql` / `api.fold_per_model`), or
its per-component breakdown drifts from the `SUM(cost_usd)` total it
claims to decompose. Totals themselves always come from the stored
per-record `cost_usd` — do not recompute them at read time.

## Model resolution flags estimates (SV-RATE-ESTIMATES)

`pricing.resolve()` returns `kind`: `exact` | `tier` | `default`.

- Model ids are normalised first: provider/region prefixes stripped
  (`us.anthropic.`, `anthropic/`) and `.` → `-`, so `claude-opus-4.8`
  resolves the same as `claude-opus-4-8`.
- An EXACT match allows only a dated-snapshot (`-20250514`) or bracket
  (`[1m]`) suffix after a table key. A short version suffix must NOT
  match a shorter key — billing `claude-opus-4-9` at `claude-opus-4`'s
  retired 15/75 is a silent 3x overcount.
- Unmatched Claude models fall back to their family's current-generation
  LIST rates and are flagged `tier`; anything else is `default`.
  Non-exact resolutions surface as `estimated_rate` in the API so a
  guessed figure is never presented as fact.

Never invent a rate for a variant we have no published price for
(e.g. `-fast`): let it fall back and be flagged.
